                                                    The Papaya application is an ESN Matching System founded by our
                                                    fellow colleagues from ESN Modena. It allows for a simple and 
                                                    efficient way of matching local buddies and exchange students 
                                                    in need of a helping hand. When creating a Papaya account, users
                                                    are asked for some basic information such as their field of study,
                                                    interests, hobbies etc. This information is needed in order for the
                                                    application to calculate the percentage of affinity between users 
                                                    based on the provided data, which would help the local admin in 
                                                    making the final match between buddies and exchange students, 
                                                    hopefully resulting in new friendships! ðŸ˜Š
