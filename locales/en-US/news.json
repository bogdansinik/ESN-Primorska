      "content": "On the 14th of October 2022, around 40 students from the University of Primorska hopped on a bus and hit the road for ESN Primorska CS’s first ever three-day Slovenian Trip!\n\nOur first day was hectic in the best way possible. Starting with Celje Castle, where we learnt about the royal family who lived within its walls and saw a breathtaking view of Celje and the rivers that run through it. Afterwards, we visited a couple of local museums to further learn more about the history of Celje, and then grabbed a bite to eat during our free time before leaving for Maribor. Once we got to Maribor, we all settled into our rooms in the hostel and got ready for the night’s event; Pub Crawl with ESN Maribor! We had a lovely night walking around the center of Maribor and it was great meeting some of the Erasmus students there.\n\nThe second day was filled with sightseeing and nature as we left Maribor in the afternoon and headed to Slovenia’s crown jewel: Lake Bled. We had lunch and regained our energy before splitting into groups to explore Bled. The first group went on a walk around the lake and enjoyed the lovely autumn trees and beautiful landscape the area had to offer. The second group went on a small hike up towards Bled Castle and visited the museum inside it, after enjoying the gorgeous view of the lake from above. At the end of the day, we headed out to Bohinj, where we spent the night around a campfire before going to sleep.\n\nOn the third and final day, we spent the morning in Bohinj. We walked towards the lake and took a panoramic boat ride. We admired the gorgeous views of lake Bohinj from the boat and had a little history lesson from the guide onboard. We later hopped on the bus and headed to our last destination: Kranj. In Kranj we once again split into groups, the first group went to the Prešeren House and learnt about Slovenia’s beloved poet France Prešeren. The second group had a tour of the Old Tunnels under Kranj, where they learnt about their importance during WII.\n\nOverall, our first ever Slovenian Trip was a great success to be remembered by everyone. We cannot wait for our next one",

      "title": "ESN pub quizzes",
      "date" : "August 4, 2022",
      "content": "Pub quizzes in general are a fun way to test your knowledge on random topics, challenge yourself and your friends and work together as a team. Gather your friends or come and join others who are looking to meet new, diverse and interesting people. What makes ESN quizzes fun is that no matter the culture and personal experience, everyone is competitive and enjoys taking part in guessing the answers to the unexpected questions.\n\nWhat students can expect from ESN pub quizzes is fun, chaos, learning some fun facts and as well as meeting new friends. The host of the event said that her favorite part of it was seeing the reactions to the questions and the creative answers that groups provide and how much knowledge they had in these random categories. By the end, you can expect to certainly make new friends, learn impressive info that may or may not be useful in everyday life and maybe even win a prize if your team is especially well informed.\n\nWill there be more events like this one? Yes! You can follow @primorska_exchange to know when and where, but pub quizzes are something that we plan to continue and even make themed ones that could be extra fun.",

      "title": "Karaoke night",
      "date" : "August 2, 2022",
      "content": "Every now and then, people want to take a break from their everyday activities and do something different. So if you like getting up on stage with your friends and putting on a show, karaoke is a place for you! Originally started off as sing-alongs in the 60s, karaoke has made its way through time and space into hearts of many people, including members of ESN Primorska!\n\nLast semester, we collaborated with Center Mladih Koper (CMK) on multiple occasions, and one of them was karaoke nights! Students stated that it was their favorite event as it gave them the freedom of choosing music that they would listen to, discover new songs, and meet people,... Hence it becoming our flagship event!\n\nOn September 29., we organized the first international karaoke night of the semester as a part of the orientation days! Hosted by members of the ESN; Enej Adamič and Lana Jurišić (yours truly). It was attended by 100+ students (both Erasmus students and freshmen) and by every criteria it was a very successful night! There were songs sung in many different languages, including English, Spanish, Serbian, Macedonian,...\n\nAs usually it started with people individually (or in pairs) going up on stage and singing, but as the night progressed people just joined when they heard a song they loved - which is what makes esn karaoke nights unique and magical!\n\nCenter Mladih Koper - CMK (Youth Center Koper, eng.) was founded in 2014 in the of city of Koper. Right now it has two spaces; one in the center (Gregorčičeva ulica 4) and one up on the Markovec (Cesta na Markovec 65a). Among the aims and objectives of the establishment are: coordination activities for youth; provision of suitable spaces and content for spending unorganized free time of young people; provision of educational, entertainment and other content for quality leisure time of young people; provision of mentoring to young people and youth organizations;...\n\n“Karaoke night in Center Mladih Koper was a perfect start to our new life in Slovenia. I've met a lot of new friends from different countries. We sang a lot of songs. At first, I was shy because I have stutter problems and I didn't want to sing, but I had to be creative and that's why I chose to sing ”Tequilla\" and now a lot of people who were there recognize me because of that performance. I was feeling like a star of the night.And then when I got comfortable, I sang a lot of songs and my stutter was not a problem. My top 3 performances of the night were mine with Tequilla, Makedonsko devojce with other Macedonians and Waka Waka with the Spanish people. It was awesome and we all want to have another Karaoke Night.” - Adrijan Joveski first year student\n\nStay tuned for more events like this at even more locations! And hopefully have you sing some songs with us! ;)",
